# CSPackets
An implementation of most 1.8.9 Minecraft packets for use with [CSModLoader](https://github.com/CoolSpy3/CSModLoader). Most of these packets are generated using [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) and `generator_specification.yaml`, however, many more complex packets also have explicit definitions.
